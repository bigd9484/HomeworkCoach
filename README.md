# 🧠 HomeworkCoach

**HomeworkCoach** is an open-source Python agent designed to simulate an intelligent school assistant for students at home.

It:
- 📋 Pulls assignments from a local mock JSON file (`school_portal.json`)
- 🤖 Uses a language model (e.g. GPT or Claude via API) to break assignments into manageable steps
- ➗ Simulates a math coach using a local model or placeholder quiz logic
- 🗣️ Interacts with students via voice prompts (simulated using `input()`)

## 📦 Features

- Modular structure for easy integration with real portals or APIs
- Can be adapted to real-time edtech or homework automation tools
- Runs locally—no complex infrastructure needed
